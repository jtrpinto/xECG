## Summary
This repository contains the code used for our paper on intepretability for ECG biometrics. In this work, we implemented the model proposed in (1) for ECG biometrics in PyTorch and trained it on the PTB (2) and UofTDB (3) databases, with varying number of subjects. We then applied interpretability tools from Captum (4) to understand how the model behaves on these diverse settings. We find that the QRS complex is the most relevant part of the ECG for identification in smaller sets of subjects and on-the-person signals. Nevertheless, when considering more challenging off-the-person contexts and larger populations, the model uses information from the different ECG waveforms more evenly.
